This project is a digital love letter.
--------

A piece of work to try and see what I can do with the Mixtape concept with a girl who lived on the other side of the world. I wanted to have Mixtapes that I can change at any time, and can be a surprise for her. Plus Spotify has a lot of music to work with.

This iPad / iPhone app will log into a Spotify account and will look for a folder of your choosing, it'll show playlists inside that folder as piles of album art and upon touching will switch to a swipable collection of music to choose from. 

You can log in yourself to your own spotify account, Spotify Unlimited only - sorry!
